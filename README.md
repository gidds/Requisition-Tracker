# Requisition-Tracker

A simple replacement for an exman pad to write what needs to be ordered and who requested the items. 

Changing pages on a exampad means loosing a "entry" and searching what the last items were on a previous order is a honnest pain. 

Requisition Tracker is the way. 

Ideas to be added and expanded on:
- Drag-and-drop functionality to move requisitions between categories
- Due dates and reminders for requisitions
- Assigning requisitions to specific users or teams
- Commenting and discussion threads for requisitions
- Integration with other systems, like inventory management or procurement systems

In Trello, you have boards, lists, and cards that help you organize and track tasks and projects. Similarly, in Requisition/requisition.py, you have a system for managing requisitions, which could be thought of as a simplified version of a project management system.

Here's a rough analogy between the two:
- Boards in Trello ≈ Departments in Requisition/requisition.py- 
- Lists in Trello ≈ Requisition categories (e.g., "Pending", "Approved", "Rejected") in Requisition/requisition.py
- Cards in Trello ≈ Individual requisitions in Requisition/requisition.py

Of course, this is a rough analogy, and Requisition/requisition.py is a much simpler system than Trello. But it's interesting to think about how the concepts and ideas from Trello could be applied to a system like Requisition/requisition.py.
