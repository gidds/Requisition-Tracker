# Requisition-Tracker

A simple replacement for an exman pad to write what needs to be ordered and who requested the items. 

Changing pages on a exampad means loosing a "entry" and searching what the last items were on a previous order is a honnest pain. 

Requisition Tracker is the way. 

Ideas to be added and expanded on:
- Drag-and-drop functionality to move requisitions between categories
- Due dates and reminders for requisitions
- Assigning requisitions to specific users or teams
- Commenting and discussion threads for requisitions
- Integration with other systems, like inventory management or procurement systems
